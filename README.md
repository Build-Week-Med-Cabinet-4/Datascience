# Datascience
Datascience / Flask API

This repo contains all of the data science contributions to the Med Cabinet build week. The strain-api folder contains files creating the
api, connection to the database, and a file that loads the data to be used by a pickled model. The main repo contains three csv files, 
strain_data.csv is a dataset that was merged with a kaggle dataset to create the one our models were trained on, the final_merge3 file. 
The best_merge file is used to create a database that users can query themselves. You can find the cleaning and collection of these in 
cleaning.py.
